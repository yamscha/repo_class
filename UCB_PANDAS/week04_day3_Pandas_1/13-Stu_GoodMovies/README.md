# We Like Good Movies

## Instructions

1. Use Pandas to load and display the CSV provided in `Resources`.

2. List all the columns in the data set.

3. We're only interested in IMDb data, so create a new table that takes the Film and all the columns relating to IMDB.

4. Filter out only the good moviesâ€”i.e., any film with an IMDb score greater than or equal to 7.

5. Find less popular movies that you may not have heard about in 2015 - i.e., anything with under 20K votes

6. Finally, export this file to a spreadsheet, excluding the index, so we can keep track of our future watchlist.
