# Variance and Z-Score

## Instructions

For each activity below, assume the input is a simple list.

* Write a function to calculate the variance of a list of numbers.

* Write a function to calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers.

* Write a function to calculate the z-score for the number at a given index in a list.

* Use your functions to characterize the lists provided in the [samples file](Resources/samples.py). Do the statistics make sense?

* As a **bonus**, write a function to that returns the z-score for every number in a list. This should take only one line of code.

* As a **bonus**, write a function that returns the z-score for every number in a list, zipped with the numbers associated with each z-score. For example, your output should look something like `[(1, 1.414), ...]`. This should take only one line of code!
