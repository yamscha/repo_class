# Foreign Keys

In this activity, you will create and populate two new tables with foreign keys that reference your existing data.

## Instructions

* Create a `customer_email` table with a foreign key that references a field in the original `customer` table.

* Populate the `customer_email` table with the information already in the `customer` table.

* Create a `customer_phone` table with a foreign key that references a field in the original `customer` table.

* Populate the `customer_phone` table with the information already in the `customer` table.

## Hints

* Think about how you can select certain columns in a table. Now what if you could take that result and use it to insert data into a table?
