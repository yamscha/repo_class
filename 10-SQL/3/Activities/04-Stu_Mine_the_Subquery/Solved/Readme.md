# Mine the Subqueries

## Instructions

1. Using subqueries, identify all actors who appear in the film _Alter Victory_ in the `sakila` database.

    ```sql
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM actor
    WHERE actor_id IN
    (
      SELECT actor_id
      FROM film_actor
      WHERE film_id IN
      (
       SELECT film_id
       FROM film
       WHERE title = 'ALTER VICTORY'
      )
    );
   ```

2. Using subqueries, display the titles of films that were rented out by an employee named Jon Stephens. 

   ```sql
   SELECT title
   FROM film
   WHERE film_id IN
   (
      SELECT film_id
      FROM rental
      WHERE staff_id IN
      (
       SELECT staff_id
       FROM staff
       WHERE last_name = "Stephens"
       AND first_name = "Jon"
      )
   );
   ```

## Bonus

* For problem No. 2, refine the query to select for films that were rented on May 31st, and whose titles begin with the letter **C**.

* Hint: you may wish to look into using **wildcards** in MySQL.
 
  ```sql
  SELECT title
  FROM film
  WHERE film_id IN
  (
     SELECT film_id
     FROM rental
     WHERE staff_id IN
     (
      SELECT staff_id
      FROM staff
      WHERE last_name = "Stephens"
     )
     AND rental_date LIKE '%05-31%'
  )
  AND title LIKE 'C%'
  ;
