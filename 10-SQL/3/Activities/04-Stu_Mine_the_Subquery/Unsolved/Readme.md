## Instructions

1. Using subqueries, identify all actors who appear in the film _Alter Victory_ in the `sakila` database.

2. Using subqueries, display the titles of films that were rented out by an employee named Jon Stephens. 

## Bonus

* Hint: you may wish to look into using **wildcards** in MySQL.
