# Unions

## Instructions

1. Using union, write a MySQL statement to query the number of rows in tables `city` and `country`.

2. Use union to display from the tables `customer` and `customer_list` the ID of all customers who live in the city of London. Determine whether both tables contain the same customers by using `UNION ALL`.

## Hint

* For the second problem, consider using subqueries.
