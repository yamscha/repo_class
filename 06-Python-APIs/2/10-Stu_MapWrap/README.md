# OpenWeather API Wrapper

This activity demonstrates the additional ease of use afforded by API wrappers.

## Instructions

  * Install the openweathermapy API wrapper.

  * Create a settings object with your API key and preferred units of measurement.

  * Get data for each city that is listed within `cities.csv`.

  * Create a list to get the temperature, latitude, and longitude in each city

  * Create a Pandas DataFrame with the results.

  * Print your summaries to verify that everything went smoothly.
  
Hint: Don't forget to utilize the openweathermapy documentation where needed: http://openweathermapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Bonus:

  * If you finish early, read about and experiment with the `*` syntax.

  * Pass a `columns` keyword argument to `pd.DataFrame`, and provide labels for the temperature and coordinate data.
