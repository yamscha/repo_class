# Far Far Away 

* **Instructions:**

  * Using the starter file provided, collect the following pieces of information from the Star Wars API.

  * The name of the character

  * The number of films they were in

  * The name of their first starship

  * Once the data has been collected, print it out to the console.

* **Hints:**

  * It would be in the programmer's best interest to print out the JSON from the initial request before anything else. This will let them know what keys they should reference.

  * The "starship" values are links to another API call. This means that the programmer will need to create a request based off of the values of a previous request.

* **Bonus:**

  * Come up with a way in which to collect and print out all of the film names a character was in.
