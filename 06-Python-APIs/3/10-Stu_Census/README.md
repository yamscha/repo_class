# Census Activity

In this activity we will utilize the Census API in order to obtain census data at a state level.

## Instructions

* Using [Census_States_Unsolved.ipynb](Unsolved/Census_States_Unsolved.ipynb) as a reference, create a completely new script that calculates each of the following fields at the **state** level:

  1. Population

  2. Median Age

  3. Household Income

  4. Per Capita Income

  5. Poverty Count

  6. Poverty Rate

  7. Unemployment Rate

* Save the resulting data as a csv

### Hints

* See documentation for the [Census API Wrapper](https://github.com/datamade/census)
