## Instructions

* Create a surfer class that has name, hometown, rank, wipeouts, and surfer count.

* Create a method called `speak` that prints "Surfs up!"

* Create a method called `biography` that prints the surfer's name and hometown.

* Create a method called `cheer` that will print "I totally rock ever since I hit my head on that magic dolphin!" if the surfer has no wipeouts. Otherwise, it prints 'I think I can, I think I can...'.

* Create two surfers that print out all their info and run all the methods.


## Bonus
* Add a method to your class that prints out how many surfers are currently shredding.

## HINT

* Make sure to set a variable to keep track of surfers before you initialize but after you declare the class.
