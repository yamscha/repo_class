## Instructions

* In this activity, you will scrape the [Python Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)

* Use Beautiful Soup to scrape only threads that have two or more comments, then print the thread's title, number of comments, and the URL to the thread.

* Your output should look something like this:
