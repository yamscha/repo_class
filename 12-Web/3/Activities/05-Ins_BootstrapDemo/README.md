# Bootstrap Demo

* The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate how the Bootstrap grid can be used to create a web layout.

## Instructions

* Open the `index.html` file in both your browser and in your editor.

* In your web browser, read the explanation for the Bootstrap grid, while noticing how the code compares to the rendered page.

* Notice how the medium sized columns go full wide if you shrink your browser window by dragging the edge. This is Bootstrap's default behavior, which makes our websites somewhat mobile responsive out of the box.
