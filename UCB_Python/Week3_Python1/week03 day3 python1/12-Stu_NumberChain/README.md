# Number Chain

Chain up the numbers

## Instructions

* Using a while loop  ask the user "How many numbers?" then print out a chain of descending numbers.

* After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.

  * If "y" keep the chain running.

  * If "n" exit the chain.

## Bonus

* Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers start and the end of the previous chain.
